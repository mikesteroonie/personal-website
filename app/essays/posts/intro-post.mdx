### Beginning

I used to be a very avid writer in high school, and as the years go by, especially with the rise of AI, I feel that writing is a lost art.

To survive AP Lang and AP Lit you would need to find a way to share your thoughts in a compelling way with stylistic prose, nowadays with AI being so disposable everyones voice seems to blend with each other.

I’m not absolved of blame here as I am currently working on infra to enable AI to be more ubiquitous, but writing as a skill is something that can easily be lost if not practiced which is why I would like to keep it as a muscle I will continue to flex.

After a personal interaction with Paul Graham—moments before he invested in our company—I read some of his essays and was in awe with how compelling of a writer he was on such a simply designed website.

In this day and age presentation speaks before you do, and good design keeps people captivated, but keeping someone scrolling paragraphs to read your essay on a site just with html is a superpower.

### Why Essays?

Publishing writing requires one to stay sharp and up to date on the current state of affairs, and I guess I hit a couple birds with one stone by keeping myself accountable with this.

It’s one thing to journal and put down a word vomit of thoughts—which I have done a fair share of—but just something about formalizing the process of writing and being very meticulous of my language is something that actually excites me, since it hasn’t been something I do very often.

### The Future

Going forward I will be posting more of my personal learnings, thoughts, insights about how I see the world and feel about things, and will leave most of the engineering talk and blabber for the AgentMail blog and social media. Granted I will be biased in that most of my waking hours involve me working with AgentMail but I will try and be as transparent as possible.

I see this as me putting a more human side of myself onto the internet. I do love editing videos there’s that (inshallah I will post more vlogs) but something about being a captivating writer is powerful.

As I enter this new chapter of my life post-YC, I look forward to sharing very authentic and raw, but at the same time curated collection of thoughts in my essays.

Here’s to writing more.
